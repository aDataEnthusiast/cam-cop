# CamCop

CamCop was designed as a background service for Windows 10 and MacOS X that would send mobile push notifications to the user's phone in the event of a webcam or microphone activation on their home computers or laptops. The motivation behind this project was the prevalence of cyber harassment and interpersonal abuse that is conducted through remote spying tools. 

In addition to designing the application, we conducted a small user test experience and interviews about the subject's awareness and concerns related to cyber abuse.
